                        *****ID*****
        ->The id attribute is used to uniquely identify a single element on a page. 
        ->Each id must be unique within a document, meaning no two elements can share the same id.

        Characteristics:
        1.Unique per document
        2.Used for a single, specific element
        3.Often used to apply specific styles or manipulate elements with JavaScript

                        *****CLASS*****
        ->The class attribute is used to identify one or more elements that belong to the same class. 
        ->Unlike id, multiple elements can share the same class name. 
        ->This is useful for applying the same styles or behavior to a group of elements.

        Characteristics:
        1.Not unique, can be used by multiple elements
        2.Used for styling groups of elements
        3.Often used to apply common styles or manipulate groups of elements with JavaScript
