            ->The <svg> tag in HTML is used to define vector-based graphics for the web. 
            ->SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) allows you to create images and graphics that are scalable, resolution-independent, and can be styled with CSS and manipulated with JavaScript. 
            ->SVG graphics are defined in XML format.

            SVG consists of a variety of elements and attributes for drawing shapes, paths, and text. Here are some of the common elements:

            1.<circle>: Draws a circle.

                "cx": The x-coordinate of the circle’s center.
                "cy": The y-coordinate of the circle’s center.
                "r": The radius of the circle.
                "stroke": The color of the circle's border.
                "stroke-width": The width of the circle's border.
                "fill": The color inside the circle.
                
            2.<rect>: Draws a rectangle.

                "x": The x-coordinate of the rectangle’s upper-left corner.
                "y": The y-coordinate of the rectangle’s upper-left corner.
                "width": The width of the rectangle.
                "height": The height of the rectangle.
                "rx": The x-axis radius of the rectangle's corners.
                "ry": The y-axis radius of the rectangle's corners.

            3.<line>: Draws a line.

                "x1": The x-coordinate of the start of the line.
                "y1": The y-coordinate of the start of the line.
                "x2": The x-coordinate of the end of the line.
                "y2": The y-coordinate of the end of the line.

            4.<ellipse>: Draws an ellipse.

                "cx": The x-coordinate of the ellipse’s center.
                "cy": The y-coordinate of the ellipse’s center.
                "rx": The x-axis radius of the ellipse.
                "ry": The y-axis radius of the ellipse.

            5.<polygon>: Draws a closed shape with multiple sides.

                "points": A list of points, defining the vertices of the polygon.

            6.<polyline>: Draws an open shape with multiple sides.

                "points": A list of points, defining the vertices of the polyline.

            7.<path>: Draws complex shapes.

                "d": A series of commands and parameters to define the path.

            8.<text>: Draws text.

                "x": The x-coordinate where the text starts.
                "y": The y-coordinate where the text starts.
