        ->HTML entities are special characters used to represent reserved characters or other characters that are not easily typed on a keyboard. 
        
        ->These entities start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). 
        
        ->They are used to display characters that have a special meaning in HTML (like <, >, &) or to represent characters from different languages or special symbols.

        Here are some common HTML entities:

            1. "&lt;" - Less than (<)
            2. "&gt;" - Greater than (>)
            3. "&amp;" - Ampersand (&)
            4. "&quot;" - Double quotation mark (")
            5. "&apos;" - Single quotation mark (')
            6. "&nbsp;" - Non-breaking space

        The <pre> tag in HTML is used to define preformatted text. 
        
        Text within this tag is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and whitespace (spaces, tabs, and line breaks) is preserved. 
        
        This makes the <pre> tag particularly useful for displaying code snippets, ASCII art, or any other content where the format must be maintained.

        The <code> tag in HTML is used to define a piece of computer code. It is typically used to display inline code snippets within a paragraph or other block of text. When combined with the <pre> tag, it is commonly used to display blocks of code with preserved whitespace and line breaks.
